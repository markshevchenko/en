My name is Mark Shevchenko and I'm programmer. Now I work to Yandex and write on C#.
Also I organize meetings of the [Moscow Programmers' Club](https://prog.msk.ru).

As an activist of the Club I help to colleagues to make interesting technical presentations and write good articles.

I have the expirience of the leading of small teams, but I prefer a sweet programming. I share my knowledges in presentations, articles and courses.

I like hard problems and strong teams.
